## 🪄 AI & Enhancement Tools

### Perspective Fix (📐)
Located in the **AI TOOLS** tab. Use this to automatically detect the corners of a document (like an ID card on a desk) and flatten it into a perfect rectangle.

### Clean Document (📝)
Located in the **AI TOOLS** tab. This removes shadows and background noise, leaving a crisp black-and-white style document that looks professionally photocopied.

### Privacy Blur (🕵️)
Perfect for sensitive IDs. This automatically detects human faces in the scan and applies a blur for privacy before saving.

## 🏷️ Watermarking & Annotation

1. Go to the **ANNOTATE** tab.
2. Select a watermark text (e.g., "COPY").
3. Choose a position (e.g., "center").
4. Click **Apply** to permanently stamp the document.
5. Use **Add Text** to type your own notes anywhere on the page.

## 💾 Saving & Exporting

### Save as PDF
The most common export. Found in the **HOME** tab. This combines **all pages** currently in your sidebar into a single multi-page PDF file.

### Save as Image
Saves **only the currently selected page** as a high-quality JPEG.
