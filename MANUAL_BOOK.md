# InerScan Pro - User Manual

## 1. Getting Started
Welcome to InerScan Pro! This application turns your scanner into a powerful document digitization tool.

### Prerequisites
- A scanner connected via USB (WIA compatible).
- Windows OS.

## 2. Scanning a Document
1.  Ensure your scanner is on.
2.  Click the blue **START NEW SCAN** button in the left sidebar.
3.  The standard Windows Scan dialog will appear. Select your settings (Color/B&W, DPI) and click **Scan**.
4.  The scanned image will appear in the main preview area.

## 3. Editing Your Scan
Once an image is scanned, you can improve it using the **Image Adjustment** tools:

- **Rotate (↺ / ↻)**: Fix orientation.
- **Flip (H / V)**: Mirror the image if needed.
- **Brightness/Contrast**: Use the sliders to enhance readability.
- **Crop Tool**: Click "Crop Tool", draw a box on the image, and confirm to remove unwanted borders.
- **Remove White Background**: Automatically makes the white paper background transparent (great for signatures or stamps).
- **Auto Crop**: Automatically trims empty space around the content.

## 4. Book & Duplex Tools
Scanning a book or double-sided documents?
- **Split Page (L/R)**: Takes a single scan of two pages and splits it into two separate pages in your list.
- **Interleave Stacks**: If you scanned a stack of front pages, then the stack of back pages, use this to merge them into the correct order (1, 2, 3, 4...).

## 5. Exporting
- **Filename Prefix**: Enter a name (e.g., "Invoice_Jan").
- **Save Location**: Choose where files are saved.
- **Save Current (JPG)**: Saves the currently visible page as an image.
- **Save All to PDF**: Compiles ALL scanned pages into a single PDF file.

## 6. Troubleshooting
